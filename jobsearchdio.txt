I like to join the porject team because first of all I really am interested
in learning how to use the technology listed here. I also am interested in 
apps that work with sorting/filtering datas. I'm gonna contribute to the team
by being accountable in learning the technolgy and communicating with my team 
member well to make sure we're able to build the back-end well. I also will
do whatever necessary task to complete the project.
